# sre-challenge-04-decentralized-exchange
This repo contains my implementation of SpeedRunEthereum — Challenge 04: DEX. The project builds a minimal Automated Market Maker (AMM) that supports: pool initialization, ETH↔ERC20 swaps, liquidity provision &amp; withdrawal, and a price formula with trading fees (0.3%). Built with Scaffold-ETH 2, Hardhat, and Next.js.
